<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Banner][react-logo]

Hello! my name is Colston D. Bod-oy, I'm a React developer and was currently taking my 2nd year of college on the time that I made this repo. I'm an aspiring developer and I would like to work for the big FAANG companies someday üòâ.  
  
I created this project so I could keep track and recall things that I didn't know I could do in JavaScript as I've just recently started learning it, hope you'll find these notes useful! üòé.


### README Template

Here's where I got this template btw, also don't forget to follow me on my social media links.
